# OpenClassRooms_Project7
Solve problems by using algorithms coded in Python


# Project presentation
The present project is the seventh one of the training course *Python Application Developer*, offered by OpenClassRooms and aims to *Solve problems by using algorithms coded in Python*.


The main goal is to develop a **brute force algorithm and an optimised algorithm** wich allow to **find the best investments** from a CSV file containing data related to financial actions (cost and benefit).

The brute force algorithm must:
- explore all possibilities of investment
- display the best result

The optimised algorithm must:
- answer in least than 1.0 second
- find and display the best investment as possible


Note: One of the main point of the project is to be able to explain algorithms and their limits, in an educational way.
